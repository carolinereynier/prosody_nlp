What parts of filenames mean:

turn: 	   turn-based, rather than sentence-based. If it's sentence-based, it's not marked.

sp: 	   includes speech features
nonsp: 	   doesn't include speech features

glove:	   uses glove embeddings
bert: 	   uses bert embeddings

long: 	   uses all training examples
medium:	   uses training examples up to 270 tokens long
short: 	   uses training examples up to 200 tokens long
The sentence-based version doesn't use this distinction: it always uses all training examples,
because they never get as long.

S_ROOT:		   This flag means that only multi-sentence turns were given an 'outer level'
		   In this case, that was an outer layer that was labelled S. The default is
		   to put an outer level labelled TOP on all examples.
