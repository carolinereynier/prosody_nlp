# Update 4/6/2018

# Step 1: Produce sentence alignments by tokens and ms sentences
# 1a: get single-sentence error alignments (i.e. matching in 
# slash unit boundaries, but might have INS/DEL/SUB errors on 
# word-level) + temporary alignments for boundary mismatches

# prep for ALL files
python get_tree_examples_with_alignments.py --file_num 0

# OR for individual files
python get_tree_examples_with_alignments.py --file_num 2005

# This produces:
  - fileNum_{A,B}_pairs.txt: file with sentences with different boudary issues:
    + first few lines show alignment of sentences MS-PTB pairs
    + Under MS_sents: sent_id, ms_sent, comb_ann, times
    + Under PTB sents: sent_id, ptb_sent, ptb_parse (mrg)
  - fileNum_{A,B}_singles.tsv: files with sentences that have within-sentence
    transcript issues (potentially). This is tsv with columns: 
    [sent_id, ms_sent, ptb_sent, comb_ann, times, mrg]
    These sentences essentially have the same sent_id between MS-State,
    PTB parse, and PTB disfluency annotation sentences, but there are 
    transcription errors
  - fileNum_{A,B}turn_sentNum.ms: single-sentence files to facilitate running 
    a separate parser directly on these files, which then produces k-best 
    parse hypotheses (Step 2)

# 1b: merge then split sentences in different sides of boundary mismatches,
# to produce similar file to *_singles.tsv, so that Step 3 can be done
# in the same way
python pairs_to_singles.py --file_num 2005 --speaker A

# This produces file: 2005_A_updated_pairs.tsv, which has the same format/
# columns as 2005_A_singles.tsv, but ptb_sent and mrg fields are actually the
# intermediate trees, not the original from treebank.

# Step 2: Create parse candidates for ms sentences
# (change data directory to point to folder with outputs of Step 1)
./run_bkparser_all.sh

OR 

./bkparse_wrapper.sh with modified input file in "SENT_FILE"

# Step 3: convert/analyze trees
python convert_and_analyze_trees.py \
           --ms_hypo_dir <DIR_TO_MS_PARSES> \
           --out_dir <DIR_TO_DUMP_OUTPUT> \
           --sent_file debug-sents-train.txt \
           --fcompname debug-sents-train-k10-updated.tsv \
           --draw_tree {1,0}
